        It is a Shopify alternative <b>running 100 % on-chain with Bitcoin as a native payment.</b> There
        is no need to install any additional software to use this app – it is all approachable via web
        browser.
      </p>

      <p class="py-6">
        We implemented CRUD support for products, categories, orders. You can also upload images for
        each product that are also stored on-chain.
      </p>
      <p class="py-6">
        Unique BTC address is generated for each order – the backend is able to verify the payment
        automatically.
      </p>
      <p class="py-6">
        We used Sveltekit to build the frontend of this app and the backend is written in the Motoko
        language, designed to write smart contracts on the IC. Source code is available in this
        GitHub repo with <b>open source</b> license.
